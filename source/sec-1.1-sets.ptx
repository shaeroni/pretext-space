  <!-- <em> is like \emph -->
  <p> 
    Modern mathematics makes heavy use of <em>sets</em>.  
    A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects.  We won't try and pin
    it down more than this---our intuition about collections
    of objects will suffice.

      When you pursue more rigorous math,
      you rely on definitions to get yourself out of philosophical jams.  For instance,
      with our definition of set, consider ``the set of all sets that don't
      contain themselves''.  Such a set cannot exist!
      This is called <em>Russel's Paradox</em><idx><h>Russel's Paradox</h></idx>, and shows
      that if we start talking about sets of sets, we may need more than
      intuition.

    <p> 
      We write a set with curly-braces { and } and
      list the objects inside.  For instance
    </p>
    <!-- <me> seems to be similar to \[   \] -->
    <me>
        \Set{1,2,3}.
    </me>
    
    <p>
      This would be read aloud as ``the set containing the elements <m>1</m>, <m>2</m>, and <m>3</m>''.
      Things in a set are called <em>elements</em> <idx><h>Set</h><h>element of</h></idx> 
      and the symbol <m>\in</m> <idx><h>Symbols</h><h><m>\in</m></h></idx> 
      is used to specify that something is an element of a set.
      In contrast, <m>\notin</m> <idx><h>Symbols</h><h><m>\notin</m></h></idx>
      is used to specify something is not an element of a set.  For example,
    </p>
    <me>
      3\in\Set{1,2,3}\qquad 4\notin\Set{1,2,3}.
    </me>
